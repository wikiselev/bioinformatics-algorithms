# Bioinformatics Algorithms

Here I will store interesting bioinformatics algorithms which I learnt via [Bioinformatics algorithms online course](https://class.coursera.org/bioinformatics-001/) together with [Stepic online educational resource](https://beta.stepic.org/). All scripts are very useful for everyday work.

List of all scripts and explanation to them can be found at the repository's [wiki](https://github.com/wikiselev/bioinformatics-algorithms/wiki). Please find all the descriptions there. Note that here I don't provide any solutions to the course scored assignments. These are optional questions.

Please let me know if you have any comments or useful feedback! Enjoy!
